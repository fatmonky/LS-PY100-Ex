'''
When the user inputs 10, we expect the program to print The result is 50!, but that's not the output we see. Why not?

def multiply_by_five(n):
    return n * 5

print("Hello! Which number would you like to multiply by 5?")
number = input()

print(f"The result is {multiply_by_five(number)}!")

# my ans: numeber is a string, not an int. So it won't be multiplied by 5, but instead just printed 5 times.

# the solution is: 

def multiply_by_five(n):
    return n * 5

print("Hello! Which number would you like to multiply by 5?")
number = int(input())

print(f"The result is {multiply_by_five(number)}!")
